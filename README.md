# Hi there, I'm glad you're here 👋

I'm a tech enthusiast focused on **Computer Networking**, **System Administration**, and the foundations of **Cloud and DevOps**. I enjoy exploring how systems connect, communicate, and scale — and I'm always building toward a deeper, practical understanding of modern infrastructure.

### 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On:
- Managing Ubuntu servers and experimenting with **Docker** and **load balancing**
- Gaining a solid grasp of **network protocols**, IP addressing, and CCNA-level networking concepts
- Learning to script and automate tasks to improve efficiency and reliability

### 🧠 My Learning Mindset:
I'm someone who learns best by **doing, testing, and troubleshooting**. I ask questions, break things and fix them. Whether it's configuring a system or optimizing a setup, I aim to understand the *why* behind the *how*.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies I Use:
- **OS**: Ubuntu, Windows
- **Tools**: Docker, Git, VirtualBox
- **Languages**: Python, Bash
- **Topics**: Networking (CCNA), System Admin, Scripting, Linux Services, AWS Services
